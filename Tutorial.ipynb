    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python-package `WeatherForcastWrapperAPI` contains 6 wrapper functions to get weather related data of any place in the world. These functions process API [http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en#web_interface](http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en#web_interface) to get data. Some functions provide 8-days weather forecast for civil, astro and meteo. At this moment only civil is live as due to time constraint, we were not able to include the Meteo and Astro. This shows forecast for 8 days, shows interpretable graphical interface. This package contains four internal functions to request API which are not available to user. The following parameters are passed to this API to get various incormation related to weather forcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter\tDescription\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "1. lon\t[deg, float] -> WGS84 coordinates of the site.\n",
    "2. lat\t[deg, float] -> WGS84 coordinates of the site.\n",
    "3. ac\t[km, int] -> Altitude Correction, only used in ASTRO forecast. Should be 0 (default), 2 or 7.\n",
    "4. lang\t[str] -> Language. Used in CIVIL, CIVIL Light, TWO, and ASTRO. Permissible values: en.\n",
    "5. unit\t[str] -> Unit used. Permissible values: metric, british. (At some point \"british\" will be replaced by \"imperial\".)\n",
    "6. output\t[str] -> Output format. Permissible values: xml, json.\n",
    "7. tzshift\t[int] -> Adjustment of timezone. Permissible values: 0, 1 or -1.\n",

    "### Install Package\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install the package by typing: pip install Wrapper-Weather-Module-V1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import Modules from Package\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add package to the python instance by typing: import Wrapper-Module as wm\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Functions Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of 6 wrapper functions available to user is given below:\n",
    "1. coordinates(city = 'Kelowna')\n",
    "2. documentation_cloud_cover(dataframe)\n",
    "3. documentation_ppt_amt(dataframe)\n",
    "4. documentation_wind_spd_10m(dataframe)\n",
    "5. documentation_weather_type(dataframe)\n",
    "6. wiki_timezone(city = 'Kelowna')\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed description of these functions as given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. coordinates(city = 'Kelowna')\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes user given city name and based on the same returns the latitude and longitude of the place anywhere around the world. The function accepts the city name in its full form not abbreviated. If user does not pass any argument then Kelowna is used as an argument which returns the data of whole Kelowna as a whole. For this project we also need to pass the product (civil/astro/meteo) however due to time constraint, we are using 'civil'. In future, we have plans to include Astro and Meteo too. The returned data is a data frame and contains the columns including longitude and latitude. \n",

    "### 2. documentation_cloud_cover(dataframe)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `documentation_cloud_cover` returns a user interpretable cloud cover percentage based on the API Data Value received the from 7Timer function. The function accepts the number to get the cloud cover percentage details. The returned data is the corresponding cloud cover percentage details in the user readable format.
