We have mutually decided over the following rules and duties while we were working on the package. 

- Together we will explore and select the API to use for.
- Then we have decided to explore the selected API and discuss together the fuctionality that we can derive from the selected API and decide on what functionality to enhance with our wrapper API
- Together we will understand the functionality of the package together and will provide their opinions freely whenever required.
- We will share the functionality that we are going to develop from the API
- Two of the team members will start working on the functions for the package and the third member will create one function and will test creating a dummy package to save time.
- Two members who worked on the functions will create respective test cases and will check the proper functionality.
- Once all the functions and test cases are completed, merging would be done together and the third member will create the package and test if its working.
- The third member along with the other members will also work with the presentation and finalize the documents from the package.
- Final package would be created and run together along with equal division of work (which will include documentation, creating vignette, Continuous integration etc )

All the individual contributions work would be done in different branches and would be merged later on.
